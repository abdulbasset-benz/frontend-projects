In this repo, I will be doing the Frontendmentor challenges starting from easy to hard

And learning as I go. 

they say that the best thing when you learn code is to practice, practice, practice!!

so from now on, this repo will document my journey into mastering website programming, which is a never ending journey!

sit tight and enjoy!
